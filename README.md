# Pet Adoption System

This repository contains the code for the Pet Adoption System, a web-based platform designed to streamline the process of adopting pets from animal shelters. The system provides features for both adopters and shelter admins, enabling seamless pet listing, adoption requests, pick-up scheduling, and notifications.

**Introduction**

The Pet Adoption System is designed to facilitate the pet adoption process for animal shelters and adopters. It replaces manual processes, offering a user-friendly web interface where users can browse available pets, submit adoption requests, and manage profiles. Shelter admins handle pet listings and adoption management, improving operational efficiency.

**Purpose**

This project aims to develop a streamlined and efficient pet adoption system to improve the adoption experience for both shelters and potential adopters.

**Features**
1. **User Registration and Authentication:** Users can create accounts and log in securely.
2. **Profile Management:** Users can update personal details and view their adoption history.
3. **Pet Listing:** A detailed listing of all available pets, with information about breed, age, and status.
4. **Adoption Request:** Users can submit requests to adopt pets of their choice.
5. **Pick-Up Scheduling:** Users can schedule a pick-up date for adopted pets.
6. **Notifications:** Receive updates on adoption status, new pet listings, and scheduled visits.
